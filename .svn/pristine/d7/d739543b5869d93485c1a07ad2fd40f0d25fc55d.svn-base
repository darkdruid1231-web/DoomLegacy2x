/*!
  Actors are used to tell the renderer where to draw an image,
  tell the world simulation when objects are contacted,
  and tell the sound system how to position a sound.
 
  The renderer uses the snext and sprev links to follow
  lists of things in sectors as they are being drawn.

  The xyz origin point represents a point at the bottom middle
  of the sprite (between the feet of a biped).
  This is the default origin position for patch_ts grabbed
  with lumpy.exe.
  A walking creature will have its z equal to the floor it is standing on.
 
  The sound code uses the x,y, and subsector fields
  to do stereo positioning of any sound emitted by the Actor.
 
  The play simulation uses the blocklinks, x,y,z, radius, height
  to determine when Actors are touching each other,
  touching lines in the map, or hit by trace lines (gunshots, lines of sight, etc).
  The flags fields have various bit flags used by the simulation.
 
  Every Actor is linked into a single sector based on its origin coordinates.
  The subsector_t is found with R_PointInSubsector(x,y),
  and the sector_t can be found with subsector->sector.
  The sector links are only used by the rendering code,
  the play simulation does not care about them at all.
 
  Any Actor that needs to be acted upon by something else
  in the play world (block movement, be shot, etc) will also
  need to be linked into the blockmap.
  If the thing has the MF_NOBLOCK flag set, it will not use
  the block links. It can still interact with other things,
  but only as the instigator (missiles will run into other
  things, but nothing can run into a missile).
  Each block in the grid is 128*128 units, and knows about
  every line_t that it contains a piece of, and every
  interactable Actor that has its origin contained.
 
  A valid Actor is a Actor that has the proper subsector_t
  filled in for its xy coordinates and is linked into the
  sector from which the subsector was made, or has the
  MF_NOSECTOR flag set (the subsector_t needs to be valid
  even if MF_NOSECTOR is set), and is linked into a blockmap
  block or has the MF_NOBLOCKMAP flag set.
  Links should only be modified by the [Un]SetPosition() functions.
  Do not change the MF_NO? flags while a thing is valid.
 
  Any questions?
