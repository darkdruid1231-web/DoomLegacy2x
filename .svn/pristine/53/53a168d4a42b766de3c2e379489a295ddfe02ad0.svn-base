/// Originally a bug in the player spawning code. When there are several player_x
/// playerstarts in a map, the real PlayerPawn is spawned to the last one and the rest
/// spawn Voodoo dolls attached to the player.
///
/// In our implementation the doll is attached to a PlayerPawn (its victim).
/// Basically whatever happens to the doll, happens to the pawn.
/// Exceptions: recoil, sector damage.
