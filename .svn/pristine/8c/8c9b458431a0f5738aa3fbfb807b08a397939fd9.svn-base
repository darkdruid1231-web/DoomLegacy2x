/*!
  Every single Actor in the game belongs to a team.
  Some teams are always fixed, others can be created and destroyed.
  - Team 0 is always the "individual" team.
    Fellow teammates are targeted and attacked if the Actor AI so demands.
    In a DM game all players belong to team 0.
  - Team -1 is the "Hellspawn" team, in which all Doom creatures belong by default.
  - Team -2 is the "D'Sparil" team, in which all Heretic creatures belong by default.
  - Team -3 is the "Korax" team, in which all Hexen creatures belong by default.
  This means that if you put Hellspawn and Heretic monsters in the same room, they will
  attack each other unless they are specifically assigned to same team.
  Team score is only kept for teams > 0.
